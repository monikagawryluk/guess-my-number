# Guess My Number

A game where the player has to guess a number between 1 and 20. The player gets information whether the submitted number is too low or too high. The maximum score that the player can get in each game is 20 points. After each incorrect guess, the score is decreased by 1. The highest score of all games from one session is saved, so that it can be beaten in next games.
